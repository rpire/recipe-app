# Recipe App

Recipe App is a project from the fifth module of the Microverse program. With it, we learned how to build applications using the `Ruby on Rails` framework.

Recipe App is a blog-based application that lets you create a user, log in, create and share recipes with diverse food and ingredients. The application is built in a way that you can only create a recipe and add food to your food list if you are logged into the site. Otherwise, you will only be able to see the public recipes. 

You can navigate the pages using the Nav Bar. The Nav Bar has routes to different views depending on if you are logged in or not. The following links can be found there:
- Public recipes.
- My recipes.
- My foods.
- Shopping details.

## Built With
